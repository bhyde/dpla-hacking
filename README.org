* Intro

The [[http://dp.la.org][Digital Public Library of America]] is interesting and they have an
[[http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/][API]], so this is some code to play with that.

The cl-dpla package is established via cl-dpla.asd by doing:
#+begin_src lisp
(ql:quickload "cl-dpla").
#+end_src
It exports cl-dpla:request which will make a request of
the API parse the json and return it.  For example:
#+begin_src lisp
(cl-dpla:request :items :q " :items :q "guastavino")
#+end_src
Note that currently there is no comprehension of json-ld, sad isn't it.

The dpla-hacking package is established by dpla-hacking.asd by doing
#+begin_src lisp
(ql:quickload "dpla-hacking")
#+end_src

It doesn't export anything.  It is just some random (incomprehensible)
hackery.
